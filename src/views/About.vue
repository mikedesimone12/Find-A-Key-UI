    <h2>We musicians learn all these fancy chords, scales, arpeggios,</h2>
    <h2>yet we have trouble coming up with a quick answer to these types of questions...</h2>
    <br><h3><b>What key are we in? When should I use this scale?</b></h3>
      <h3><b>How do I know what chords work together?</b></h3><br>
      <p>When beginners are learning about music theory, the difficult part seems to be grasping
      the relationship between chords and scales (God help those music students who had to memorize the Circle of Fifths!).
      This inspired me to come up with a simpler and more visual way to demonstrate these relationships. And I also wanted
      to experiment with a new front-end language, so ya know, two birds one stone. But essentially, this application can be used as a cheat sheet 
      for novice musicians who are learning to improvise with scales or write their own chord progressions.<br><br>Enjoy! And stay tuned
      for more features and music theory tools!
