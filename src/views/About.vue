    <br><h3><b>What key are we in? When should I use this scale?</b></h3>
      <h3><b>How do I know what chords work together?</b></h3><br>
      <p>When beginners are learning about music theory, the difficult part seems to be grasping
      the relationship between chords and scales. This application can be used as a cheat sheet 
      for novice musicians who are learning to improvise with scales or write their own chord progressions.<br><br>Enjoy!
